# React Inline Styling
``` Front-end ``` | ``` JavaScript ``` | ``` ES6 ``` | ``` React```

This project explores styling in React applications, transitioning from traditional CSS to inline styling, Aphrodite (CSS-in-JS), conditional styling, responsive design, and CSS animations. The goal is to understand the differences between CSS and JS-based styling approaches, and how to implement responsive, animated UIs in React.
